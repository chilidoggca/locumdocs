  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Locumunity is the first centralized online platform that allows healthcare facilities to connect directly with job-seeking physicians. A physician-led startup we aim to cut costs by up to 80% and speed up access to candidate profiles within minutes by using machine learning and automation to revolutionize the healthcare staffing/recruitment process. Locums can search for work when they want, where they want and clinics are able to find the coverage they need. Message each other directly to find locums, telehealth or permanent jobs all in one easy place. Unlike other websites we tell you all the details without having to call someone.</p>
